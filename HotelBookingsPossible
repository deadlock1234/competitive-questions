*A hotel manager has to process N advance bookings of rooms for the next season. His hotel has K rooms. Bookings contain an arrival 
date and a departure date. He wants to find out whether there are enough rooms in the hotel to satisfy the demand.

Input :  Arrivals :   [1 3 5]
         Departures : [2 6 8]
         K: 1
Output: False
Hotel manager needs at least two
rooms as the second and third 
intervals overlap.
